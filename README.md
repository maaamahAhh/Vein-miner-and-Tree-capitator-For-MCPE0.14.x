# Vein Miner + Tree Capitator for MCPE 0.14.x (ModPE/BlockLauncher)

This is a ModPE script for Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.14.x that adds both Vein Miner and Tree Capitator features.  
It requires BlockLauncher to load. Made by me.

With this script, you can:

- Mine an entire vein of stone by breaking a single block
- Chop down a whole tree by breaking the bottom log
- Works with most standard tools (pickaxes, axes)
- Automatically drops items for all affected blocks
